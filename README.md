# ContactList
ContactList GUI created in Java

This program lets you add contacts to a table and much more!. You can sort the table by any category, update a contact, delete a contact, and reset the whole table. I also implemented regular expressions to guide correct user input.

The program also utilizes the following features:
-Save your table and/or open a new one
-Color picker to change the background color
-Select a languange (English, Dutch, French)
-About me page

Feel free to use this code to help jumpstart your own Java projects :)
